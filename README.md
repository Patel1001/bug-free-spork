# bug-free-spork

This website was made as a final project for a web development class taken at Dalhousie University in Winter 2023 and therefore has some fefatures that are added
 specifically for the assignment specifications and some restrictions placed on which resources we could use. 3 launguages have been used for the making of 
 this webiste - HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
