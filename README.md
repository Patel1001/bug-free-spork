## General Overview -
This website was made as a final project for a web development class taken at Dalhousie University in Winter 2023 and therefore has some fefatures that are added
 specifically for the assignment specifications and some restrictions placed on which resources we could use. 3 launguages have been used for the making of 
 this webiste - HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 



## Features


Navigation: The site has a navigation bar that allows users to seamlessly move between different sections: Home, Education and Work experience, and Contact.

Content Sections: Each page (index.html, Education_WorkExp.html, ContactMe.html) contains specific content related to Darsh's introduction, education, work experience, and ways to get in touch.

Styling: The CSS file (styles1.css) is used to style the website, including different modes like normal mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode.

Interactive Elements: Utilizes JavaScript (javaScript1.js) for interactive elements such as hiding the photo gallery, displaying the current time, and cycling through images.

 ## Concepts and Technologies Used


HTML: Used for structuring the content of each webpage (index.html, Education_WorkExp.html, ContactMe.html).

CSS: Styling and visual presentation of the website, including responsiveness across different devices.

JavaScript: Implementing interactive features, including mode changes, photo gallery interactions, time display, and image cycling.

Embedded Media: Utilizes video (Introduction_Video.mp4), audio (InterstellarAudioFile.mp3), and an embedded YouTube video (k9WqpQp8VSU) to enhance user experience.

## Instructions

Navigation: Use the navigation bar to explore different sections.

Modes: Experiment with different modes (normal, dark, high contrast) using the buttons provided.

## Notes

Contact: Users can reach out to Darsh via email or LinkedIn provided in the Contact section (ContactMe.html).
Feedback: Visitors can also submit feedback through the form available in the Contact section. (this was only needed for visulization therefore the feedback isn't actually sent anywhere when submit is pressed)
